## Dashboards

### World Economic Forum (WEF)

Selecting individual economic metrics for a dashboard reflects the values of a society.  The challenges of measuring an economy's success by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are and continue to be noted.  The WEF is reviewing different economic measures because of international concerns over sustainable development and changing economies.  The WEF stated that:

> Despite extensive efforts to anchor alternative measures of economic performance, GDP growth today remains a core economic policy objective and is still often treated as both a necessary and sufficient marker of success. Yet targeting a recovery and future trajectory of GDP growth alone will not be sufficient to advance the holistic economic and societal reset that is needed today.

> An accelerated international convergence on a dashboard of core metrics to steer consistent, forward-looking economic and social policy and business decisions will be critical.

The WEF report, [Platform for Shaping the Future of the New Economy and Society:
Dashboard for a New Economy Towards a New Compass for the Post-COVID Recovery](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Dashboard_for_a_New_Economy_2020.pdf), urged the adoption of new metrics.

## Installation

You can install the released version of econdash from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("econdash")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(econdash)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
